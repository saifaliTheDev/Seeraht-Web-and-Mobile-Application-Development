    <h2>Semantic Elements</h2>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;When building web pages, we use a combination of
        non-semantic <strong>HTML</strong>
        and Semantic <strong>HTML</strong>. The word semantic means <strong><i>“relating to meaning”</i></strong>, so
        semantic elements provide information about the content between the
        opening and closing tags.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;By using Semantic <strong>HTML</strong>, we select <strong>HTML</strong>
        elements based on their meaning, not on how they are presented. Elements such as <b><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></b>
        and <b><code>&lt;span&gt;</code></b> are not semantic elements since they provide no context as to what is
        inside of those tags.</p>

    <p>&emsp;&emsp;For example, instead of using a
        <b><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></b> element to contain our header
        information, we could use a <b><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></b> element, which is used as a heading
        section. By using a <b><code>&lt;header&gt;</code></b> tag instead of a <b><code>&lt;div&gt;</code></b>, we
        provide context as to
        what information is inside of the opening and closing tag.

    <h2>Why Use Semantic Elements? </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>

            <p>
                <strong>Accessibility: </strong>Semantic <b>HTML</b> makes webpages
                accessible for mobile
                devices and for people with disabilities as well. This is because screen
                readers and browsers are able to interpret the code better.

            <p>
                <strong>SEO:</strong> It improves the website <strong>SEO</strong>, or
                <b>S</b>earch <b>E</b>ngine <b>O</b>ptimization, which
                is the process of increasing the number of people that visit your
                webpage. With better <b>SEO</b>, search engines are better able to identify the
                content of your website and weight the most important content
                appropriately.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>

            <p><strong>Easy to Understand: </strong>Semantic <strong>HTML</strong> also makes
                the website's source
                code easier to read for other web developers.</p>
        </li>





    </ul>
    <p>
        &emsp;To better understand this, you can think of comparing non-semantic <b>HTML</b>
        to going into a store with no signs on the aisles. Since the aisles aren't labeled,
        you don't know what products are in those aisles. However, stores that do
        have signs for each aisle make it a lot easier to find the items you need, just
        like Semantic <b>HTML</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
        &emsp;Many web sites contain <b>HTML</b>
        code like: <b><code>&lt;div id="header"&gt;,</code></b> <b><code>&lt;div id="nav"&gt;,</code></b>
        <b><code>&lt;div id="main"&gt;,</code></b> <b><code>&lt;div id="footer"&gt;</code></b> to indicate
        header, navigation, main content and footer.
