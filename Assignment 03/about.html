        <p>Who is that would loan Allah a goodly loan so He may multiply is for him many times over? (Surat Baqara,
            Verse 245)</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            It should be noted that Allah, who is in need of no one and nothing, instills upon his men to give
            Qarz-e-Hasana because it is in man's nature to be frugal whilst spending his wealth. Allah speaks about qarz
            because it is returned and Allah promises that He will return the goodly loan by 70 folds. Allah conveys his
            message to the Muslim ummah through the Holy Prophet Muhammad prompting Muslims to spend their wealth in a
            certain way. He says,Oh children of Adam! Trust me with your wealth. If you do so, no fire, flood or thieves
            will be able to rob you off your money. Instead, you will be endowed with your wealth when you most need it.
            He further says that the poor and weak will not remain hungry and naked except due to the negligence of the
            rich, who should not be stingy in spending their money on those worse off than themselves. Allah will not
            only take strict accountability from those people but He will also punish them accordingly. On the Day of
            Judgement, the rich will be humiliated because they did not help the needy. The needy will complain to Allah
            and say that all those men on whom you graciously bestowed the rights of wealth showed negligence in its
            proper use; they were spending on themselves and forgot about us, the ones who needed it. Allah will reply
            to this and say: "I swear on my respect and glory! I will bring you closer to me and push them further
            away."
            <br>
            <br>
        <p>Alhamdollilah, Allah has accorded our organization with the highest favor by spending those people our way
            who follow the teachings of the Holy Quran and Hadith, give zakat, fidyah, fitrah, khairat and other
            donations to help us help those in need. The purpose of sending this message to you is so that you not only
            spread this message to others but also play your part in helping us to continue serving and helping the
            needy till the Day of Judgement.</p>
